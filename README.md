- 👋 Hi, I’m Tiago Santo.
- 👀 I’m interested in software development and I'm studying ADS at FIAP
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python/Java/JS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something about tech, now I feel out place from my vocation.
- 📫 How to reach me: tiagoalvessoares17@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have been studying programming for 2 years, and I feel insecure about acting in this field.
